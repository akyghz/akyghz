        <br>There was darkness, and now there is light.<br> As if it was proclaimed the sun broke forth triumphantly, warmed the earth, spreading its gleaming tendrils to every corner of the world, and chased away the dreadful night. Like a symbol of joy itself the beams hound out the last of the shadows which used to haunt the land. The night itself is the very epitome of sorrow, the being of death and blackness, where as the sunrise is the bearer of hope, the emblem of new life and rebirth. Through the darkness which seems to prevail, the night whose blackness seems to never end, the sun manages to once again rise over the horizon and illuminate the planet with its glorious rays.</p>
